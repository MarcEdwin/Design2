These are instructions for command line or cmd:

"To start server use : c:\install location path\server\3.4\bin\mongod "
"if the path has spaces in it, place it in quotations

"to connect to server use : c:\install location path\server\3.4\bin\mongo "

enter "db", to show what databse is currently in use
enter "show dbs" to see all available databases
enter "use <database>" to use an existing database or create a new one and use it

MongoDB saves data into collections. this allows us to enter information at random
	without following the table format.
files to be imported into the database need to end in a .json format

to import files, open a new cmd windo, 
and enter "mongoimport --db "database name" --collection "collection name" --drop --file ~"path of file to be imported"
 
--drop will drop existing database with the name, and generate a new one.
--file specifies file path

db."collectionName".find() will print all items in collection
